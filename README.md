# ThermiteMinigame
NoPixel Thermite minigame I remade in Unity3D. 

How it looks like: https://imgur.com/a/bERLH4D

Made for fun and as an experiment mostly for viewers who want to compete with others and test if they're any good at it. If you play on the server, play/train on your own discretion.

To start the game you'll need to:

  1) Unzip the folder
  2) Save all the files in 1 folder
  3) Open Thermite minigame.exe in there

Made by Smokyy__ on twitch.

# Hurray game is now playable through web!
Finally published it as WebGL game on github pages. Now you don't even need to download it. 
(Except if you want to resize the window, you'll have to either download the game or change resolution inside of inspect element)

(Btw I am not even sure if this minigame is still on NoPixel, since I haven't watched any streams for almost a year)
