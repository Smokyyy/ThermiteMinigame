# ThermiteMinigame
NoPixel Thermite minigame I remade in Unity3D. 

How it looks like: https://imgur.com/a/bERLH4D

Made for fun and as an experiment mostly for viewers who want to compete with others and test if they're any good at it. If you play on the server, play/train on your own discretion.

To start the game you'll need to:

  1) Unzip the folder
  2) Save all the files in 1 folder
  3) Open Thermite minigame.exe in there
